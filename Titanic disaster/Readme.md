# Titanic Data Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, where we investigate the relationships between various features such as age, passenger class, and survival outcomes. The analysis involves data visualization and basic statistical methods to uncover patterns and insights.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset from the tragic sinking of the Titanic in 1912. The dataset includes information on passengers such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived. This analysis aims to explore these variables to understand what factors influenced survival rates.

## Key Findings

- **Passenger Class and Survival**: There is a significant correlation between passenger class and survival rates. Passengers in 1st class had a higher survival rate compared to those in 2nd and 3rd class. This indicates that socio-economic status was a crucial factor in survival chances.
  
- **Age Distribution**: Younger passengers, particularly children, had higher survival rates. This suggests that age played an important role in survival, with younger passengers potentially receiving priority during evacuation.

- **Combined Impact of Age and Class**: The interaction between age and class revealed that being in a higher class generally improved survival chances across most age groups. However, even younger passengers in lower classes had better survival odds than older passengers in the same class.

## Conclusion

This analysis sheds light on the socio-economic and demographic factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. Further analysis, such as feature engineering or predictive modeling, could be conducted to predict survival rates more accurately.
