# **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis** ‚úàÔ∏èüìä  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction data to identify key factors influencing customer experiences. The dataset includes various attributes such as flight distance, customer demographics, service ratings, and overall satisfaction levels.  

## **Objectives**  
- Understand the main drivers of passenger satisfaction.  
- Explore relationships between different service factors and customer ratings.  
- Use data visualization to highlight key insights.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains:  
- **Categorical variables** (e.g., Gender, Travel Type, Customer Type)  
- **Numerical variables** (e.g., Flight Distance, Age, Departure Delay)  
- **Satisfaction labels** (Satisfied / Neutral or Dissatisfied)  

## **Analysis Process**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Checked for duplicate records  
   - Converted categorical features for analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated **heatmaps** to explore correlations  
   - Used **histograms & count plots** to analyze distributions  
   - Created **pie charts** to show category distributions  

3. **Key Findings**  
   - **Flight distance and service ratings** significantly impact customer satisfaction.  
   - **Business travelers** tend to have higher satisfaction compared to economy travelers.  
   - **Delays (departure & arrival)** are strongly correlated with dissatisfaction.  

## **Visualizations**  
- **Correlation Heatmap** ‚Üí Shows feature relationships.  
- **Satisfaction Distribution** ‚Üí Highlights trends across different groups.  
- **Service Rating Analysis** ‚Üí Evaluates the impact of different service aspects.  

## **Conclusion & Recommendations**  
- Improving **on-time performance** and reducing delays can enhance customer satisfaction.  
- Enhancing **in-flight service quality** (comfort, entertainment, and meals) is crucial.  
- Airlines should personalize services for **frequent flyers & business travelers** to boost loyalty.  

## **Next Steps**  
- Apply **machine learning** to predict satisfaction levels.  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on customer feedback (if available).  
- Compare different airline companies to benchmark performance.
