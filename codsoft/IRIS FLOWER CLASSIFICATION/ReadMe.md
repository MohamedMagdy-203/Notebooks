# IRIS Flower Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into different species using classification techniques.

## Project Overview
The IRIS Flower Classification project applies machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the well-known IRIS dataset, which includes the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target Variable)


## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Classification Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)

## Results
The models are evaluated based on classification metrics. The best-performing model is selected for final predictions.
