# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using various regression techniques.

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project applies machine learning algorithms to analyze the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes information about passengers such as:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of Parents/Children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)


## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Regression Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)

## Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy and other relevant metrics. The final model with the best performance is selected for prediction.
