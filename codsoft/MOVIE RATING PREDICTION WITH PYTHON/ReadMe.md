# Movie Rating Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts movie ratings using regression techniques.

## Project Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction project applies machine learning algorithms to predict movie ratings based on various features. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate a movie's rating based on available data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:
- Movie Title
- Genre
- Director
- Cast
- Budget
- Box Office Revenue
- User Reviews
- Critics' Scores


## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Regression Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R-squared Score)

## Results
The models are evaluated based on error metrics such as RMSE and MAE. The best-performing model is selected for final predictions.
